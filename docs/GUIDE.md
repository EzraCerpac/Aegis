## Overview

Aegis transforms your macOS menu bar and notch area into a powerful control center for managing workspaces and windows. It provides:

- **Visual workspace indicators** showing all spaces with window icons
- **Notch HUD** for volume, brightness, now-playing music, Bluetooth devices, Focus mode, and system notifications
- **System status** display (battery, WiFi, Focus mode, clock)
- **Window management** via drag-drop and context menus

Aegis communicates with Yabai in real-time via a FIFO pipe, ensuring instant updates when you switch spaces or move windows.

---

## Requirements

### System Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| macOS | 14.0+ (Sonoma or later) |
| Hardware | Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3) with notch recommended |
| Yabai | 7.0+ installed and running |

### Permissions Required

Aegis requires the following permissions:

1. **Accessibility** - For menu bar display and window tracking
2. **Automation** - For controlling Yabai and Music.app
3. **Notifications** - For startup status notifications (optional)

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Yabai

If you haven't already installed Yabai:

```bash
brew install koekeishiya/formulae/yabai
```

For full functionality (space management, window moving between spaces), you need to:

1. Partially disable SIP (System Integrity Protection)
2. Install the Yabai scripting addition

See the [Yabai Wiki](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki) for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Install Aegis

**Option A: Download Release**

Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/aegis/releases) and drag Aegis to Applications.

**Option B: Build from Source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aegis.git
cd aegis
open Aegis.xcodeproj
# Press Cmd+B to build, Cmd+R to run
```

### Step 3: Grant Permissions

On first launch:

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Enable Aegis in the list
3. You may be prompted to grant Automation access - click Allow

---

## Yabai Integration Setup

Aegis communicates with Yabai via a FIFO pipe. This requires a one-time setup.

### Automatic Setup

Run the setup script (created automatically on first launch):

```bash
~/.config/aegis/setup-aegis-yabai.sh
```

The script will:

1. Create `~/.config/aegis/` directory
2. Install `~/.config/aegis/aegis-yabai-notify` notification script
3. Register Yabai signals for real-time events
4. Optionally add integration to `~/.yabairc` for persistence

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup, add this to your `~/.yabairc`:

```bash
# AEGIS_INTEGRATION_START
AEGIS_NOTIFY="$HOME/.config/aegis/aegis-yabai-notify"
yabai -m signal --add event=space_changed action="YABAI_EVENT_TYPE=space_changed $AEGIS_NOTIFY" label=aegis_space_changed
yabai -m signal --add event=space_destroyed action="YABAI_EVENT_TYPE=space_destroyed $AEGIS_NOTIFY" label=aegis_space_destroyed
yabai -m signal --add event=window_focused action="YABAI_EVENT_TYPE=window_focused $AEGIS_NOTIFY" label=aegis_window_focused
yabai -m signal --add event=window_created action="YABAI_EVENT_TYPE=window_created $AEGIS_NOTIFY" label=aegis_window_created
yabai -m signal --add event=window_destroyed action="YABAI_EVENT_TYPE=window_destroyed $AEGIS_NOTIFY" label=aegis_window_destroyed
yabai -m signal --add event=window_moved action="YABAI_EVENT_TYPE=window_moved $AEGIS_NOTIFY" label=aegis_window_moved
yabai -m signal --add event=application_front_switched action="YABAI_EVENT_TYPE=application_front_switched $AEGIS_NOTIFY" label=aegis_application_front_switched
# AEGIS_INTEGRATION_END
```

### Scripting Addition (SA)

For full functionality, the Yabai scripting addition should be loaded. Add to your `~/.yabairc`:

```bash
# Load scripting addition (requires sudoers entry)
sudo yabai --load-sa
yabai -m signal --add event=dock_did_restart action="sudo yabai --load-sa"
```

See [Yabai Wiki - Installing the Scripting Addition](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Installing-yabai-(latest-release)#configure-scripting-addition) for sudoers configuration.

### Verifying Setup

After setup, check the status in Aegis:

1. Right-click the layout button (left side of menu bar)
2. Look at the **Status** section:
   - **Yabai**: Should show version number
   - **SA**: Should show "Loaded"
   - **Aegis**: Shows Aegis version
   - **Link**: Should show "Active"

If SA shows "Not loaded", click it to load with an admin prompt.

## Features

### Menu Bar Components

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Layout] │ [1 🌐📧] │ [2 💻📝] │ [3 🎵] │     ⊙     │ 🔋 📶 10:30 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↑            ↑                              ↑           ↑
  Actions   Space indicators               Notch area   System status
```

### Space Indicators

Each space shows:
- **Space number** (1, 2, 3...)
- **Window icons** for apps on that space
- **Active state** highlighting for the current space
- **Stack badges** showing stacked window count

### Layout Actions Button

By default, left-click executes the selected layout action and scrolling cycles through actions. Right-click opens the full context menu. Enable `contextButtonMenuOnly` to make both left-click and right-click open the menu; scrolling is then ignored and the button stays on the `≡ Menu` indicator.

**Scroll wheel actions:**
- Scroll up/down to cycle through: Rotate 90°, Rotate 180°, Rotate 270°, Balance, Flip X, Flip Y, Toggle Layout

### Notch HUD

The notch area displays contextual information:

| Trigger | Display |
|---------|---------|
| Volume change | Volume icon + progress bar |
| Brightness change | Brightness icon + progress bar |
| Music playing | Album art + visualizer or track info |
| Bluetooth device connects | Device icon + name + battery ring |
| Bluetooth device disconnects | Device icon + name + "Disconnected" |
| Focus mode enabled | Focus icon + mode name + "On" |
| Focus mode disabled | Focus icon + mode name + "Off" |
| System notification | App icon + title + body text |

The HUD slides in from under the notch with smooth spring animation and auto-hides after a configurable delay.

#### Media HUD

The Media HUD shows album art on the left and either a **visualizer** or **track info** on the right. It works with all media sources (Music, Spotify, Safari, Firefox, Chrome, YouTube, video players, etc.):

- **Visualizer mode** (default): Animated bars that respond to playback
- **Track Info mode**: Song title and artist name
  - Expands to show full text when track changes
  - Collapses after 3 seconds
  - Long text scrolls with marquee animation
  - Tap album art to toggle between modes

**Bluetooth Device HUD:**
- Automatically detects when AirPods, headphones, speakers, keyboards, mice, or trackpads connect/disconnect
- Shows device type icon (e.g., AirPods Pro icon for AirPods)
- Displays battery level as a circular ring indicator (green/orange/red based on level)
- Separate notifications for connect and disconnect events

**Focus Mode HUD:**
- Triggers when Focus mode is enabled or disabled via Control Center or System Settings
- Shows the actual Focus mode icon from your configuration (e.g., moon for Do Not Disturb, briefcase for Work)
- Displays the mode name (e.g., "Study", "Work", "Personal")
- Shows "On" (purple) when enabled, "Off" (gray) when disabled

**Notification HUD:**
- Intercepts system notifications from any app (Messages, Slack, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Shows the app icon + notification title + body text in the notch area
- Dismisses the native macOS notification banner automatically
- Click anywhere on the HUD to open/focus the source app
  - Uses Yabai to focus the app window (respects your window layout)
  - Falls back to launching the app if no window exists
- Auto-hides after 8 seconds (configurable)
- Note: Native banner may briefly flash (~50-150ms) before being dismissed - this is a macOS limitation

### System Status

Right side of the menu bar shows:
- **Battery** - Color-coded (green/yellow/orange/red) with charging indicator
- **WiFi** - Signal strength with 3-level indicator
- **Clock** - Current time
- **Date** - Configurable format (long or short)

### Multi-Display Support

Aegis automatically detects external monitors and creates menu bars for each display. Configure via Settings or `multiMonitorMode` in config:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Auto** (default) | Single display = primary only, multiple = per monitor |
| **Primary Only** | Menu bar only on main display |
| **Per Monitor** | Each monitor shows only its own spaces |
| **All Show All** | All monitors show all spaces |

Display changes are detected instantly via CoreGraphics callbacks.

Example skhd configuration:

```bash
# Focus spaces
alt - 1 : yabai -m space --focus 1
alt - 2 : yabai -m space --focus 2
alt - 3 : yabai -m space --focus 3

# Move windows
shift + alt - 1 : yabai -m window --space 1
shift + alt - 2 : yabai -m window --space 2
shift + alt - 3 : yabai -m window --space 3

# Layout
alt - r : yabai -m space --rotate 90
alt - b : yabai -m space --balance

## Troubleshooting

### Aegis doesn't show spaces

**Check Yabai is running:**
```bash
yabai -m query --spaces
```

**Check signals are registered:**
```bash
yabai -m signal --list | grep aegis
```

**Check FIFO pipe exists:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.config/aegis/yabai.pipe
```

**Check link status:**
Right-click → Status → Link should show "Active"

### SA shows "Not loaded"

1. Click the SA status in the context menu to load with admin prompt
2. Or run manually: `sudo yabai --load-sa`
3. For automatic loading, ensure your `~/.yabairc` includes the load command and you have a sudoers entry

### Volume/Brightness HUD doesn't appear

1. Verify Accessibility permission is granted
2. Check if another app is suppressing the system HUD
3. Look for errors in Console.app (filter by "Aegis")

### Media HUD shows wrong info

1. Check your media player is actually playing (Music, Spotify, browser video, etc.)
2. Album art is cached per-track - if wrong, quit and reopen Aegis
3. The MediaRemote framework sometimes has delays - wait a moment

### Bluetooth device HUD doesn't appear

1. Ensure Bluetooth permission is granted to Aegis
2. Device must be a Bluetooth device (not USB)
3. Battery level may not show immediately for newly connected devices - system_profiler takes 1-2 seconds
4. Check logs for "BluetoothDeviceService" entries: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Aegis/aegis.log | grep Bluetooth`

### Focus mode HUD doesn't appear

1. Ensure Aegis has permission to read the DoNotDisturb directory
2. Focus mode changes must be made via Control Center or System Settings (not third-party apps)
3. Check logs for "Focus" entries: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Aegis/aegis.log | grep Focus`
4. Custom Focus modes should show their configured icon and name

### Notification HUD doesn't appear

1. Ensure Accessibility permission is granted (required for AXObserver)
2. Check that notifications are enabled for the source app in System Settings → Notifications
3. Check logs for "NotificationService" entries: `log show --predicate 'process == "Aegis"' --last 1m | grep Notification`
4. If the app icon doesn't load, the bundle identifier may not be recognized - check if the app is running

### Native notification banner flashes before dismissing

This is a known macOS limitation. The Accessibility API fires after macOS has already rendered the notification. The flash duration (~50-150ms) cannot be reduced further. Aegis dismisses the banner as quickly as possible by:
1. Dismissing BEFORE extracting notification content
2. Using the "Close" action directly (not AXPress which opens the app)

### Link shows "Not configured"

Run the setup script:
```bash
~/.config/aegis/setup-aegis-yabai.sh
```

Then restart Yabai:
```bash
yabai --restart-service
```

### Performance issues

1. Check Activity Monitor for high CPU usage
2. Progress bar animation should use ~1-2% CPU when active, zero when idle
3. Reduce max displayed icons in Settings if needed

### Logs

Aegis logs to `~/Library/Logs/Aegis/aegis.log`. View with:

```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Aegis/aegis.log
```

Or open in Console.app.

## FAQ

### Q: Does Aegis work without Yabai?

Partially. The Notch HUD (volume/brightness/music) works independently. However, the space indicators require Yabai.

### Q: Does Aegis work on Intel Macs?

Yes, but the notch HUD features are designed for MacBooks with a notch. On other Macs, the HUD appears at the top center of the screen.

### Q: Does Aegis work with multiple monitors?

Yes. Aegis automatically detects external monitors and creates a menu bar for each display. You can configure the behavior in Settings:
- **Auto**: Shows all spaces on single monitor, per-monitor spaces when multiple displays are connected
- **Primary Only**: Menu bar only on the main display
- **Per Monitor**: Each display shows only the spaces assigned to it
- **All Show All**: Every display shows all spaces

### Q: Can I use Aegis with other window managers?

Currently, Aegis is designed specifically for Yabai. Support for other window managers is not planned.

### Q: Does Aegis replace the native menu bar?

Aegis displays its own window at the top of the screen. It doesn't technically replace the native menu bar - you can still access it by moving your mouse to the very top of the screen.

### Q: How do I completely hide the native menu bar?

Use Yabai's `menubar_opacity` setting in your `.yabairc`:

```bash
yabai -m config menubar_opacity 0.0
```

### Q: Why does SA need to be reloaded after restart?

The scripting addition is injected into Dock.app and doesn't persist across system restarts. Your `.yabairc` should automatically reload it. If not working, check your sudoers configuration.

### Q: Can I customize the colors/theme?

Currently, Aegis uses system accent colors and a dark theme. Custom themes are on the roadmap.

### Q: How do I uninstall Aegis?

1. Quit Aegis
2. Delete `/Applications/Aegis.app`
3. Remove the integration from `~/.yabairc` (the section between `AEGIS_INTEGRATION_START` and `AEGIS_INTEGRATION_END`)
4. Delete `~/.config/aegis/`
5. Delete preferences: `defaults delete com.aegis.Aegis`
